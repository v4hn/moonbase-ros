cat << EOF
This project is a cross-platform library for capturing data from
the Intel RealSense F200, SR300 and R200 cameras. This effort was
initiated to better support researchers, creative coders, and app
developers in domains such as robotics, virtual reality, and the
internet of things. Several often-requested features of RealSense
devices are implemented in this project, including multi-camera capture.
