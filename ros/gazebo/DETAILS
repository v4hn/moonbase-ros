cat << EOF
Gazebo is a multi-robot simulator for outdoor environments.
Like Stage, it is capable of simulating a population of robots,
sensors and objects, but does so in a three-dimensional world.
It generates both realistic sensor feedback and physically
plausible interactions between objects
(it includes an accurate simulation of rigid-body physics).
