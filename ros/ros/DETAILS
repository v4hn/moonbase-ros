ROS is a huge standard system to control autonomous robot systems.
This package installs all required dependencies for a desktop-full
installation(without extra packages though) - it therefore
replaces lunar support in rosdep for the basic installation.
You can then continue to manually compile/install
the ros distribution as explained at
http://www.ros.org/wiki/$VERSION/Installation/Source
