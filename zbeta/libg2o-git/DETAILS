cat << EOF
g2o is an open-source C++ framework for optimizing graph-based
nonlinear error functions. g2o has been designed to be easily
extensible to a wide range of problems and a new problem typically
can be specified in a few lines of code.

The current implementation provides solutions to several variants
of SLAM and Bundle Adjustment.
